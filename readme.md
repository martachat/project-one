Game Idea: Rock Music Blind Test & Quizz

The game is meant for all the lovers of rock music who want to test their knowledge.

The game has two rounds. 
The first round is a blind music test. The user will listen to 5 songs and guess the arist among the proposed options. The song is played for 30 seconds. If the user guesses right, one point is added. If the user chooses the wrong option or fails to select one option in the given time, they will earn 0 ponts.
The second round is a music quizz. The user will have to reply to 5 different questions by choosing the right option among those given. The score logic is the same as the first round.

At the end, the user will be able to see their score. 

If the score is higher than 5, the user wins.
If the score is lower than 5, the user loses.
If the score is equal to 5, the user will get one bonus question. If they guess right, they win, if not they lose.
